# The-Cookery-Book


#### Problem Statement
Given a list of recipes, can we link a new recipe with the existing food columns and help users to try out these new recipes. Can we generate new inferences from the existing recipe book?

#### Why Machine Learning
A lot of categories are involved in the recipe book. There are chances where new categories can be included. It will not be possible to manually arrive at these patterns for different categories on a large scale.

#### Conclusion and Future Scope
* We have successfully implemented a prototype which classifies a relevant recipe as dessert and studied the features contributing to it.

* We can extend this prototype to include various targets and build a system which associates various tags when a new recipe with existing tags are added. 

* We can implement the system to support learning new tags which the user adds along with some existing tags and use that new tag as a target for classifying future recipes once enough training data is available. 

* We can also build a visualization dashboard highlighting the popularity of recipes across different countries, top ingredients contributing to a recipe, top recipes during festive times and so on.
